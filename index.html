    <h1>Socio-Economic & Geographic Correlations of Suicide Deaths</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

        <p>Just as the unemployment rate serves as a good indicator of economic health, 
            understanding the US suicide rate is important in order to assess the well-being of 
            the nation's citizens. The suicide rate shows the number of suicides 
            per capita, reflecting the prevalence of suicide and the 
            effectiveness of suicide prevention efforts. The rate serves as a 
            key indicator of public health, highlighting both mental and emotional 
            distress within a society. </p>

        <p>Examining suicide rates across various demographics and geographic locations 
            gives us valuable insights. Factors like age, gender, socioeconomic status, 
            and access to mental healthcare are all factors that play into suicide. By analyzing 
            the trends in these areas, we can identify populations most vulnerable to 
            suicide and work to better prevention strategies.</p>

        <p>Suicide rates can be influenced by various social issues. For example, increased 
            suicide rates may correlate with problems like social isolation, a lack of 
            community support, and/or substance abuse. However, addressing these social 
            issues can contribute to a decrease in suicide rates.</p>
            
        <p>With this project, we aim to indentify trends and risk groups. This would ultimately allow 
            us to help improve current suicide prevention strategies, and help them be better predictors
            when it comes to certain groups at risk.</p>      

        <p>To learn more about the relationship between GDP and suicide,
            you can read articles that examine this connection:  <a href="https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=bsba">"Does Money Buy Enough Happiness"</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5463019/">"Suicide Rates Across Income Levels"</a>.</p>


    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> The Suicide Occurences Dataset from Kaggle provides valuable insights into suicide trends worldwide. 
      It contains 27,820 rows covering 101 countries across 32 years, of data collection. The dataset includes 
      twelve variables, featuring key demographics like age and sex, as well as economic factors such as GDP 
      per capita. Each entry represents a single suicide incident, with metrics like suicides per one hundred thousand residents 
      helping to understand this complex issue. These variables are summarized in the following table:</p>

        <p>Our project also utilizes  <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/">country geographic data</a> 
          in order to better identify geographic trends among occurrences.  We hope that by identifying 
          these trends our findings can be used to better mitigate occurrences and provide more targeted 
          support to those who are more likely to be victims. 
        </p>
        <h3>Interactive Map</h3>
        <p>The first interactive visualization was an interactive world map that helped to explore
          the geographical factor we sought to analyze. There are several ways to interact with the 
          visualization. The graph can be zoomed in and zoomed out to see different countries in
           more detail, or to see the overall geographical trend of suicides. The map is colorized
            by suicides per 100k population.  </p>

            <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="website/suicidemap.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            
            <p>From this, we were able to see that Eastern and Northern
                  European countries tend to have higher suicide rates. These countries include Belarus, 
                  Kazakhstan, and Finland. Another way to interact with the visualization is through the 
                  tooltip. By hovering the cursor over a country, several suicide statistics pop up. 
                  These include the country name, GDP per year, GDP per capita, suicide count, population, 
                  and suicides per 100k population. From these tooltip statistics, we were able to see that 
                  GDP doesn’t have a noticeable effect on suicide rate. For example, the United States has 
                  13 suicides/100k population, and a high GDP per year, but Dominica has approximately 0 
                  suicides/100k population, and a low GDP per year. Vice versa, there are countries with
                   a low suicide rate and low GDP per year, and countries with a high suicide rate and 
                   high GDP per year.

        <h3>Overview of Feature Importance</h3>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <img src="website/finish.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0">></ifmg>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            For our next static visualization, we decided to utilize a feature importance graph from a random forest regression, to help us understand 
            what variable will help us predict the target variable best. A random forest regressor is a machine learning model that uses decision trees 
            to predict a continuous outcome, improving prediction accuracy and robustness by averaging the results of individual trees. 
            A feature importance graph visually represents the relative importance of each feature in the model, helping to identify which 
            variables most significantly impact the prediction. In this case, we kept the prediction variable as 
            Suicides/100k. We chose this variable because it is the best way to standardize the suicide rates with a 
            varying group of populations. When you have such a wide range of populations, it is important to find a way
            to standardize and create a basis of comparison. From our random forest regressor, we found out that 'country'
            and 'age' are the two most important factors in being able to predict suicides/100k. This did come to a surprise for 
            us, as we expected GDP to have a larger impact. This information would prove useful if we ever want to try and combine 
            these factors into a polynomial or multivariate regression to come up with the best way to accurately predict the 
            suicides/100k population. Feature importance does not imply causation; it indicates how useful each feature is for the model’s 
            predictions given the current data.

                This static visualization demonstrates the relationship between generation and the number of suicides as well as gender and the number of suicides. You can choose a country to analyze, and the United States is given as a default as this is the country most viewers likely relate to. Through the use of the positioning of the bars, the height of the bars, and the color of the bars, a few key takeaways become apparent. First, and most obvious, females have a much lower number of suicides as opposed to men. This could have been due to the way the data was gathered, but assuming it is comprehensive, this is a significant piece of information and should be taken into account in the future. The other main takeaway from this visualization is that the middle generations - that is, Boomers and Gen X - have more suicides than the other generations. However, this finding can be easily explained by population. There are simply more Boomers than previous generations, and Millenials and Gen Z are not old enough to have a significant number of suicides. In the future, it would be interesting to have a suicide rate for these generations in order to see if there is a difference. A simple way to do this would be to merge population values with this dataset and manually calculate the rate.

        <h3> Correlation Matrix for Each Variable</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>To build on the feature importance graph, we also decided to create a correlation heatmap, to 
                  be able to see the interactions between each relationship. This will back up the feature 
                  importance and show us which specific variables will impact each other. Once again, this will
                  prove helpful if we want to create a more complex multivariate regression to predict suicides/100k 
                  more accurately. One of the issues with a multivariate regression is multicollinearity; this is when 
                  the impact one variable has on the outcome variable is over or under predicted due to having a relationship
                  with another variable. One way to fix this is to create interaction terms using the confounding variables. This 
                  heatmap will allow us to make insights like this for the future. However, for now, we can simply just talk about what 
                  the heatmap contains. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation matrix, the strongest relationship is between population and gdp_for_year. If we look back
                    at the random forest regressor, both of those features were in the middle in terms of importance. Some other notable relationships 
                    include a very minimal relation (close to 0) between generation and country, and sex and country.

        <h3>Comparing GDP Per Capita to Suicides Per One Hundred Thousand</h3>
        <div class = 'center'>

      </div>
        <p>
            The purpose of this Altair interactive scatter plot is to compare suicide occurences per 100,000 population with the
            gross domestic product per capita of a selected country. The visualization also provides a correlation metric
            (R-squared) to quantify the relationship between these two variables given the selection. The design features points
            representing the graph’s mark and vertical and horizontal positions representing the graph’s channel. Additionally,
            hover data is utilized to display the country and number of total suicide occurences for a selected point. The graph
            generally showed a common positive trend between increasing GDP per capita linked to more frequent occurrences, some
            like Albania and the UAE had a weak connection. Interestingly, the UK and Switzerland saw a decrease in occurrences
            despite their growing GDP per capita, but the correlation between the two remained strong. South Korea served as another
            outlier, experiencing increases in both GDP per capita and event occurrences, but still maintaining a positive
            correlation.

        <h3>Distribution of Suicide Rates by Age Group and GDP per Capita Bins</h3>

        <div class = 'center'>

          <p>
            For our final static visualization, we decided to explore GDP a little bit more. We knew age group was a more vital component, 
            but we still wanted to see whether suicide rates would vary by GDP as well. We decided to use a boxplot to visually compare 
            the distributions of suicide rates across different age groups, and see how these distributions vary with the economic status 
            of a country. Our box plot provides a summary of the suicide rates within an age group for a given GDP per capita bin, which was 
            automatically generated from the data (by taking the range and dividing it into 3 groups). We found that there is a notable spread 
            in suicide rates within age groups, but between GDP per capita and suicide rates is not immediately apparent.

      <h3> Summary:</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Overall, this exploration was insightful into the factors that contribute to suicide in a nation. We learned that 
                  GDP and generation do not have a noticeable effect on suicide rate. In contrast, much less females took their own life 
                  than males did. We learned that ‘country’ and ‘age’ have the biggest effects on suicide rate, and that even within an 
                  age group, GDP does not affect suicide rate as much, which is something we didn’t expect. In the future, we wish to 
                  conduct more in-depth analyses on specific grouping of populations. This includes ethnicities/races, levels of income, 
                  industries, and more. Beyond analysis, these conclusions could also be used to help suicide prevention and destigmatize it. 
                  Furthermore, using all these variables to come up with the best way to predict suicide rate will also be an engaging process.
